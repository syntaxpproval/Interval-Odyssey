## Sequencer Memory Analysis - Pattern Banks

### Current Memory Usage (Single Pattern)
1. Per Step Data (4 bytes):
   - Pitch/Note: 1 byte
   - Volume: 1 byte
   - Attack: 1 byte
   - Decay: 1 byte

2. Per Channel Data (68 bytes):
   - 16 steps × 4 bytes = 64 bytes
   - Channel parameters = 4 bytes
   Total per channel: 68 bytes

3. Total Channel Data:
   - 68 bytes × 4 channels = 272 bytes

4. Control Data:
   - Position, tempo, flags = 8 bytes

Total Single Pattern: 280 bytes

### Extended Pattern Bank System
1. Four Complete Patterns:
   - 280 bytes × 4 = 1,120 bytes

2. Pattern Management:
   - Current bank index: 1 byte
   - Copy/paste buffer flags: 1 byte
   - Pattern transition flags: 1 byte
   - Reserved for future use: 13 bytes
   Total Management: 16 bytes

Total System Requirements: 1,136 bytes (13.9% of GB RAM)

### Feature Possibilities with Pattern Banks
1. Live Performance Features:
   - Pattern switching during playback
   - Pattern chaining/sequencing
   - A/B pattern comparison
   - Pattern copying/mixing

2. Composition Tools:
   - Verse/Chorus/Bridge organization
   - Pattern variations
   - Fill patterns
   - Transition patterns

3. Memory Management Strategies:
   - Could implement bank switching for inactive patterns
   - Pattern compression for similar sequences
   - Shared parameter data between patterns
   - Optimization of unused channels

### Technical Considerations
1. Performance Impact:
   - Pattern switching overhead minimal
   - No significant CPU impact
   - Main consideration would be screen updates

2. Implementation Approach:
   - Array of pattern structs
   - Pattern pointer system
   - Bank switching logic
   - Visual bank indication

3. RAM Availability:
   - 13.9% of RAM is very reasonable
   - Leaves 86.1% (~7KB) for other features
   - Could be optimized further if needed

### Conclusion
Implementing a 4-bank pattern system is entirely feasible within the Game Boy's hardware constraints. The memory usage is reasonable, and the performance impact would be minimal. This would significantly enhance the sequencer's capabilities for music composition and live performance.
