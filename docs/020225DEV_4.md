## Channel 3 Type System Bug Fixes

### Current Issues:
1. Type parameter can't be changed for Channel 3 due to menu restriction
2. Wave pattern changes don't seem to be audible

### Required Changes:
1. Modify PARAM_TYPE case in handle_sub_menu_input() to include Channel 3
2. Check TYPE_WAVE constant usage in initialization
3. Verify wave RAM pattern writing 
4. Add debug output for wave pattern changes

### Planned Implementation:
1. Allow type changes for Channel 3 by changing condition from `< 2` to `<= 2`
2. Verify wave pattern loading sequence
3. Add debug information for wave pattern changes
4. Ensure TYPE parameter is properly initialized for Channel 3
