# Development Notes - January 26, 2025 (Update 4)

## Sequencer Progress Review

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented basic two-channel operation
- Channel differentiation achieved through duty cycle manipulation (CH1: 50%, CH2: 25%)
- Stable audio playback during sequence running
- Improved text formatting and value display
- Centralized parameter value display at y=14
- Implemented channel muting
- Added EXIT option for menu navigation

### Current Issues
1. Performance
   - Screen redraw inefficiencies causing slowdown
   - Multiple redundant redraws in input handling
   - Grid updates more frequent than necessary
   - Poor performance during simultaneous editing and playback

2. UI/UX Concerns
   - Step editing limited to parameter navigation
   - Removal of grid editing mode may have reduced usability
   - Need more intuitive parameter controls

3. Audio Issues
   - Low register notes (A3-B4) playing incorrectly
   - Channel phase issues during simultaneous playback
   - Limited sound parameter implementation

### Code Optimization Notes
- Consider implementing display buffer for text updates
- Move repeated value display code to separate function
- Reduce wait_vbl_done() calls
- Review input handling structure
- Consider implementing macro system for common operations

### Next Steps
1. Core functionality
   - Implement remaining sound parameters (Attack, Decay, Volume)
   - Add Channel 3 (Wave) support
   - Add Channel 4 (Noise) support

2. UI Improvements
   - Reconsider grid editing implementation
   - Add button combination shortcuts
   - Optimize screen updates
   - Review overall UI flow

3. Audio Enhancements
   - Fix low register note calculation
   - Implement chord mode
   - Improve multi-channel timing

### Reference Notes
- GameBoy Sound Register Map:
  - CH1: FF10-FF14
  - CH2: FF16-FF19
  - CH3: FF1A-FF1E
  - CH4: FF20-FF23
- Note frequency calculation needs review for low register
- Screen drawing best practices: minimize vbl_wait calls
