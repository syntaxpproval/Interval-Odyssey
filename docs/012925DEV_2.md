# Development Notes - January 29, 2025 (Update 2)

## Tile System Testing & Animation Implementation

### Tile Tests Completed
1. Basic Characters
   - Roman numerals (I-IV)
   - Right arrow
   - Star character
   - START/SELECT multi-tile text

2. Animation System
   - POOF animation (3 frames)
   - SPAWN animation (4 frames)
   - Configurable animation speed

### Technical Implementation
1. Tile Definitions
   - Consolidated all tile definitions
   - Verified correct tile positions
   - Added multi-tile support for START/SELECT
   - Implemented animation frame definitions

2. Animation System
   - Frame-based animation control
   - Configurable timing system
   - Independent animation tracks
   - Non-blocking animation updates

### Debug Features
- Added debug menu option
- Created comprehensive tile test screen
- Real-time animation preview
- Easy return to main menu

### Future Considerations
1. Animation System Usage
   - Could be used for menu transitions
   - Player spawn/despawn effects
   - UI feedback animations
   - Status effect indicators

2. Potential Optimizations
   - Batch animation updates
   - Multiple animation speeds
   - Animation state management
   - Frame timing fine-tuning

### Notes
- All tile positions verified against tileset
- Animation system runs smoothly with current timing
- Debug menu provides good testing environment
- Multi-tile rendering working as expected
