# Development Notes - February 8, 2025 (Part 2)

## Code Comparison Analysis

### Key Differences Found:

1. State Management in handle_popup_input():
   - Old version: Uses static local `pending_operation` for state tracking
   - Current version: Uses `sequencer.bank_data.pending_operation` in global state
   - Impact: Current version may have state persistence issues affecting COPY/PASTE cycle

2. Copy/Paste Operation:
   - Old version: Simpler flag management, only resets has_copy on paste
   - Current version: Resets both has_copy and copy_buffer.has_data flags
   - Impact: Double flag reset may cause PASTE option to disappear prematurely

3. Operation Delay Handling:
   - Current version adds operation_delay system not present in old version
   - May cause timing issues with state transitions

### Problems & Solutions:

1. COPY/PASTE Cycle Fix:
   - Revert to single flag management (has_copy) for copy buffer state
   - Remove copy_buffer.has_data reset from paste operation
   - Ensure copy operation properly sets both flags

2. Bank Save/Load:
   - Current version may have incomplete SRAM synchronization
   - Need to verify save_sram_data() and load_sram_data() implementation
   - Check for correct bank mapping in SRAM operations

### Next Steps:

1. Immediate Fixes:
   - Modify handle_popup_input() state management
   - Clean up copy/paste flag handling
   - Review SRAM save/load timing

2. Verification Needed:
   - Test bank switching with SRAM operations
   - Verify both banks persist after power cycle
   - Check pattern data integrity during bank switches
