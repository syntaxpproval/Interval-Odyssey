# Development Notes - January 25, 2025

## Multi-Channel Sequencer Implementation

### Completed
- Implemented basic Channel 2 functionality
- Added channel-specific step sequences
- Updated menu system for channel selection
- Fixed note range limits (A3-G8)

### Current Issues
1. Channel 2 Differentiation
   - Currently sounds too similar to Channel 1
   - Only noticeable difference is phase when both playing
   - Need to explore duty cycle and envelope parameters

2. Test Tone Functionality
   - Test tone should reflect current channel selection
   - Verify channel switching in preview mode

3. Parameter Implementation Needed
   - Attack implementation
   - Decay implementation
   - Volume control
   - Channel-specific parameter ranges

4. Pending Features
   - Wave channel (CH3) implementation
   - Noise channel (CH4) implementation
   - Channel duty cycle controls
   - Visual improvements for Sound Mode interface

### Next Steps
1. Differentiate Channel 2 sound (explore NR21/NR22 parameters)
2. Update test tone to use selected channel
3. Implement ADSR envelope controls
4. Research Wave and Noise channel requirements
