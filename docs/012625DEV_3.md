# Development Notes - January 26, 2025 (Update 3)

## Channel Duty Cycle Implementation Notes

### Primary Changes
- Updated play_sequencer_note() - CH1: 50% duty, CH2: 25% duty
- Modified play_note_ch2() to use 25% duty cycle

### Future Considerations
- play_arpeggio() in sound.c uses different duty cycles for quiz mode
- May want to standardize duty cycles across all game modes later
- Currently leaving quiz mode functionality unchanged to maintain existing behavior
