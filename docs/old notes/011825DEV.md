## Key Randomization & Menu System Implementation

### Major Achievements
1. Fixed Key Room Randomization
   - Identified core issue with predictable randomization timing
   - Implemented entropy-based randomization using player input timing
   - Successfully achieved varying key room selection between Room 1 and Room 10
   - Debug system shows proper seed variation between game starts

2. Menu System Integration
   - Implemented basic menu structure with three options:
     - PLAY GAME
     - SETTINGS
     - MUSIC MODE
   - Preserved working randomization system while adding menu
   - Added proper game systems initialization sequence

### Technical Details

#### Randomization Solution
```c
// Wait for player input while gathering entropy
UINT16 entropy = 0;
while(1) {
    entropy++;
    if(joy & J_START || joy & J_A) {
        UINT8 div = DIV_REG;
        UINT8 tima = TIMA_REG;
        initial_seed = (div << 8) | (tima ^ (entropy & 0xFF));
        initrand(initial_seed);
        break;
    }
    wait_vbl_done();
}
```
- Uses entropy counter combined with hardware timers
- Player input timing adds true randomness
- Combines multiple entropy sources for better distribution

#### Critical System Initialization Order
```c
void init_game_systems(void) {
    init_sound();
    init_room_system();
    init_player();
    init_key_gate_system();
    draw_current_room();
}
```
- Proper initialization sequence prevents player spawn issues
- Maintains correct room state on game start
- Preserves debug mode functionality

### Debug System Notes
- All debug output consolidated in game_state.c for reliability
- Added seed value display for verification
- Room selection display shows available and selected rooms

### Future Considerations
1. Implement Settings screen
2. Develop Music Mode functionality
3. Add sound effects for menu navigation
4. Consider expanding menu visual design
5. Maintain debug compatibility with future features

### Important Reminders
- Keep debug code in game_state.c
- Always maintain proper initialization order
- Test key randomization after any major changes
- Preserve working entropy collection system

### Next Steps
1. Complete settings screen implementation
2. Design and implement Music Mode
3. Add menu navigation sound effects
4. Consider additional visual enhancements

This is a significant milestone in development, with both the key randomization issue resolved and a proper menu system implemented. The game is now closer to a complete product while maintaining all technical functionality.
