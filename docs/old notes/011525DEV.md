# Development Notes - January 15, 2025

## Key/Gate System Implementation Progress

### Current Status
1. Gate Implementation:
   - Successfully renders in gate room
   - Uses correct tile (MTL_GATE_CLOSED)
   - Placement working as intended

2. Key Implementation:
   - Debug shows correct room types and selection
   - Room 1 and Room 10 properly identified as key rooms (Type:1)
   - KeyRoom selection working (currently hardcoded to Room 1)
   - Issue identified: Key tile not persisting in room layout

### Debug Findings
1. Room Type Verification:
   - Starting room: Type:3 (ROOM_TYPE_STAGING)
   - Room 1: Type:1 (ROOM_TYPE_KEY)
   - Room 10: Type:1 (ROOM_TYPE_KEY)

2. Key Room Debug:
   - Selected key room consistently shows as 1
   - Center tile in Room 1 showing as 1 (MT_FLOOR) instead of 8 (MT_KEY)
   - Added new debug output to track key placement
3. We've discovered that only debug text from game_state.c consistently shows up, which is because it's being called every frame in the game loop

### Next Steps
1. Investigate key tile placement:
   - Verify key placement code is being reached
   - Check if tile value is being overwritten
   - Added detailed debug output for tile placement

2. Implementation Priorities:
   - Fix key tile persistence
   - Implement key pickup mechanics
   - Add HUD elements
   - Implement stage transition reset

### Reference Values
1. Tile Types:
   - MT_KEY = 8 (tile_types.h)
   - MTL_KEY = 8 (tileset.h)
   - MT_FLOOR = 1
   - MT_GATE = 6 (verified working)

### Files Modified
1. room_manager.c:
   - Added debug output
   - Modified key placement code
   - Added key placement verification

2. game_state.c:
   - Added runtime debug display
   - Added center tile value tracking

3. room_manager.h:
   - Made selected_key_room public
