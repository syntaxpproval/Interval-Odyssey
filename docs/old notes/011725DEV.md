# Development Notes - January 17, 2025

## Morning/Afternoon Progress

### Block and Gate System Improvements
1. Fixed Block Collision
   - Resolved tile definition inconsistency between MT_BLOCK and MTL_BLOCK
   - Standardized block tile value to 0 across all systems
   - Blocks now properly block player movement

2. Gate System Implementation
   - Fixed gate collision detection
   - Gate now properly blocks passage without key
   - Gate opens correctly with key
   - Debug output updated for new parameter system

3. Key Collection Fixes
   - Resolved player visibility issue when collecting key
   - Added player redraw flag to maintain sprite visibility
   - Key pickup system working as intended

4. Room Template Expansion
   - Increased number of base templates
   - Added visual variation to key rooms, corridors, and item rooms
   - Successfully implemented without breaking room generation system

### Future Development Goals

#### Priority 1: Stage Transition System
- Implement transition to Music Quiz
- Create flow: Stage 1 -> Music Quiz -> Stage 2
- Ensure proper state management during transitions

#### Priority 2: User Interface
- Develop title screen and splash image
- Create start menu system
- Implement status bar
  - Display current stage
  - Show key status
  - Other relevant game information

#### Priority 3: Audio Implementation
- Add in-game background music
- Review and enhance current sound effects
- Implement music system for different game states

### Technical Notes
1. Block System Changes:
   - MT_BLOCK definition standardized to 0
   - Collision detection verified working
   - No impact on existing room templates

2. Gate System:
   - Updated can_walk_on_gate() to use position parameters
   - Improved debug output in game_state.c
   - Gate state properly persists through room transitions

### Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of stage transition system
2. Design title screen layout
3. Plan status bar UI components
4. Research music implementation options
