# Development Notes - January 16, 2025

## Key/Gate System Implementation Progress

### Achievements
1. Fixed key placement in key room
   - Corrected room initialization sequence
   - Key now appears and persists correctly
   - Key pickup working properly
   - Key state persists through map transitions

2. Gate Room Implementation
   - Fixed game freeze when entering gate room
   - Added proper collision detection for gate tile
   - Implemented movement restriction without key

### Debug Findings
1. Room Initialization Issue:
   - Room ID was being set after room generation
   - Fixed by reordering initialization sequence
   - Key placement now triggers correctly

2. Gate Room State:
   - Debug values confirm correct tile placement (GTile:6)
   - Walk/Move flags working as expected
   - Movement validation functioning

3. Current Debug Values:
   ```
   GRoom:4 Type:2
   Key:0 Gate:0
   Pos 5,6 GTile:6
   Walk:0 Move:1 (on gate)
   Walk:1 Move:0 (off gate)
   ```

### Issues Addressed
1. Fixed game freeze issue in gate room
   - Added proper header includes
   - Corrected function declarations
   - Fixed initialization order

2. Implemented gate collision
   - Added can_walk_on_gate() function
   - Integrated with player movement system
   - Added movement permission flag

### Next Steps
1. Test gate state persistence across room transitions
2. Add visual feedback for gate interaction
3. Implement transition delay before quiz start
4. Test complete key/gate cycle with quiz completion

### Files Modified
1. item_manager.c/h
   - Added gate collision functionality
   - Implemented movement permission checks
   - Added gate state tracking

2. player.c
   - Modified movement logic
   - Added gate collision integration
   - Improved movement validation

3. game_state.c
   - Enhanced debug information
   - Added state tracking display

### Reference Values
- MT_GATE = 6
- MT_KEY = 8
- MT_FLOOR = 1
- GATE_CLOSED = 0
- GATE_OPEN = 1
