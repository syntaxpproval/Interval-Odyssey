# Development Notes - January 28, 2025 (Update 3)

## Sequencer Performance Optimization Results

### Completed Optimizations
1. Reduced screen redraw operations
   - Consolidated tile updates
   - Implemented block-based drawing
   - Optimized menu transitions
   - Added menu wraparound navigation

2. UI Improvements
   - Fixed BPM display formatting and positioning
   - Maintained BPM visibility in sub menus
   - Enhanced cursor behavior and visibility
   - Smoother menu navigation

3. Performance Enhancements
   - Reduced VBlank wait calls
   - Optimized parameter updates
   - Improved grid rendering
   - More efficient menu state management

### Future Development Plans

#### Core Sound Features
1. ADSR Implementation
   - Attack parameter
   - Decay parameter
   - Sustain/Release considerations

2. Volume Control System
   - Per-step volume
   - Channel volume management

3. Channel Expansion
   - Channel 3 (Wave) implementation
   - Channel 4 (Noise) implementation
   - Multi-channel synchronization

#### UI Redesign Considerations
1. Sequencer Layout
   - Evaluate 16-step bar vs current grid
   - Consider multi-channel simultaneous view
   - Optimize visual feedback

2. Sound Design
   - Individual channel timbre controls
   - Waveform editing capabilities
   - Sound parameter visualization

3. Advanced Features
   - Chord mode implementation
   - Channel allocation management
   - Enhanced parameter controls

### Technical Notes
- Current implementation shows significant performance improvement
- Menu navigation is more intuitive with wraparound
- Base structure is ready for feature expansion

### Next Steps Priority
1. ADSR/Volume implementation
2. Channel expansion
3. UI redesign evaluation
4. Advanced feature implementation

### Questions to Consider
1. How to maintain performance with additional channels?
2. Best approach for ADSR implementation on GB hardware?
3. Most efficient way to handle chord mode?
4. Balance between feature richness and usability?
