## Music Sequencer Issues Investigation

### Current Problems
1. Save/Load Functionality
   - Bank A save/load operations non-functional
   - Bank B saves appear to work but may have issues
   - Loading only recovers Bank B data after restart

2. Copy/Paste System
   - COPY operation not working on either bank
   - PASTE option state management issues
   - COPY->PASTE->COPY cycle broken

### Initial Code Review Findings
1. State Management Concerns:
   - Potential incomplete reset of copy/paste flags
   - Bank switching may not be properly preserving data
   - SRAM handling needs verification

2. Next Steps:
   - Review SRAM handling functions
   - Compare with previous working version
   - Analyze bank data structure implementation
   - Verify state management in popup handling

### Questions for Investigation
1. How is SRAM data being structured and accessed?
2. What are the differences in the working vs current implementation?
3. Are bank switching operations properly synchronized with SRAM operations?
