## Sequencer Performance Optimization Discussion

### Current Performance Issues
- Multiple redundant screen redraws
- Blinking cursor implementation causing constant updates
- High CPU usage during simultaneous editing and playback
- Inefficient grid update system

### Proposed Solutions
1. Replace Blinking Cursor
   - Switch to static block indicator
   - Use inverse tiles for selection
   - Separate playing step indicator from cursor
   - Reduce number of required redraws

2. Screen Update Optimization
   - Implement dirty rectangle system
   - Buffer updates for VBlank
   - Minimize full grid redraws
   - Separate parameter and grid update cycles

### Next Steps
1. Test static cursor implementation
2. Measure performance impact
3. If beneficial, implement broader update optimization
4. Consider additional visual feedback methods

### Questions to Consider
- How to clearly distinguish between selected and playing steps?
- What visual indicator would be most intuitive for users?
- Could we use hardware sprites for any elements?
- Should we separate the update cycles for different UI elements?
