## UI Rendering Issues Investigation

### Current Issues
1. LOAD operation: SAVE COPY LOAD CLEAR window not properly drawing/rendering
2. PASTE operation: Same window rendering issue
3. Window Exit: Border artifacts remain on screen after exiting

### Root Cause Analysis
1. LOAD and PASTE operations both set `sequencer.needs_redraw = 1` but don't properly clear the popup window
2. Window exit lacks proper screen clearing code
3. No explicit screen redraw after these operations

### Proposed Fixes
1. Add proper window clearing in load_current_pattern() and paste_pattern()
2. Implement proper screen cleanup on window exit
3. Ensure full screen redraw after these operations
