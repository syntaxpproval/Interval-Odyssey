# Development Notes - February 6, 2024

## UI Rendering Fixes Implementation

### Changes Made
1. Added clear_popup_window() helper function for consistent window clearing
2. Modified load_current_pattern() to clear window before loading
3. Modified paste_pattern() to clear window before pasting
4. Updated window exit handling to properly clear the entire window area
5. Improved status message handling with wider clear area
6. Added force redraw after status message clear when not in popup state

### Technical Details
- Added wait_vbl_done() calls before all screen updates
- Increased status message clear width from 6 to 8 tiles for better cleanup
- Implemented consistent window clearing through centralized helper function
- Added proper screen redraw triggers after operations

### Testing Notes
Please test the following scenarios:
1. Loading patterns - window should clear properly
2. Pasting patterns - window should clear properly
3. Exiting window with B button - no artifacts should remain
4. Status messages - should clear cleanly without leaving artifacts

### Next Steps
1. Monitor for any edge cases in the rendering
2. Consider adding additional validation for pattern load/save operations
3. Consider adding visual feedback for bank switching operations
