## Bank B Initialization Fix

### Problem Resolved
- Fixed Bank B initialization issues that were causing junk data to appear
- Resolved pattern mirroring between Bank A and Bank B
- System now works consistently across different hardware

### Key Changes Made
1. Fixed double declaration of SRAM banks in settings.h
2. Simplified `load_sram_structure()` to:
   - Only handle Bank A data loading
   - Always start with Bank B as non-existent
   - Defer Bank B initialization to `switch_bank()`

3. Enhanced `switch_bank()` to:
   - Properly save current bank state before switching
   - Handle Bank B initialization on first access
   - Save cleared state to Bank B storage
   - Maintain complete separation between bank states

### Technical Details
- Bank B is now treated as non-existent on startup
- First access to Bank B triggers proper initialization with clean pattern
- Deep copying ensures no state sharing between banks
- Proper SRAM structure management prevents data corruption

### Testing Results
- Tested successfully across different hardware
- No more junk data in Bank B
- Banks maintain independent states
- Save/Load functionality working correctly

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any edge cases in bank switching
- Consider adding additional validation checks
- Continue testing on various hardware configurations
