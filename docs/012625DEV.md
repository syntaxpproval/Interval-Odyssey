# Development Notes - January 26, 2025

## Sound Channel Implementation Status

### Current Focus
1. Channel 2 Differentiation
   - Currently too similar to Channel 1
   - Phase difference only noticeable during simultaneous playback
   - Need to explore NR21/NR22 registers for waveform shaping
   - Focus on duty cycle and envelope parameters

2. Test Tone System
   - Currently defaulting to Channel 1
   - Needs to reflect active channel selection
   - Required: Channel-specific parameter testing

### Implementation Order
1. Channel Differentiation
   - Modify Channel 2 duty cycle
   - Adjust envelope parameters
   - Verify distinct sound characteristics

2. Test Tone Updates
   - Map test tone to selected channel
   - Implement channel switching logic
   - Verify correct parameter reflection

3. Parameter Implementation (Next Phase)
   - Attack
   - Decay
   - Volume control
   - Channel-specific ranges

4. Future Development
   - Channel 3 (Wave) implementation
   - Channel 4 (Noise) implementation
   - UI/UX improvements
   - Parameter control interface
