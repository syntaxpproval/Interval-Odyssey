Session 2024-02-04
-----------------

Current Issues:
1. Input Handling:
   - Very fast/sensitive up/down movement in Main Menu
   - A button not working for Music Mode or main game selection
   - These issues appeared after SRAM implementation

2. ROM Banking/Build Issues:
   - Warning about overflow in implicit constant conversion in sequencer.c
   - ROM size issues when using ROM banking
   - Current workaround: removed ROM banking (-Wf-bo4) but kept SRAM banking (-Wf-ba4)

3. SRAM Implementation:
   - Basic SRAM structure is in place but functionality untested due to build issues
   - Need to verify pattern saving/loading once build issues are resolved

Goals for Next Session:
1. Investigate input handling issues:
   - Check if SRAM implementation in settings.c is affecting input
   - Consider moving SRAM code to separate save_manager.c/h
   - Review entire input handling chain for potential conflicts

2. Resolve Build Configuration:
   - Find proper balance between ROM banking and SRAM needs
   - Current build works but with input issues
   - May need to restructure code to better fit memory constraints

3. Test and Complete SRAM Features:
   - Once build is stable, test pattern saving/loading
   - Verify bank A/B pattern preservation
   - Implement permanent save functionality

Technical Notes:
- SRAM is configured with -Wf-ba4 flag
- Removed ROM banking due to size issues
- sequencer.c has an overflow warning that needs attention
- Current focus should be on fixing input before proceeding with save functionality

Next Steps:
1. Focus on input handling first
2. Then address ROM banking/memory organization
3. Finally implement and test SRAM features
