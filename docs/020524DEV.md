## Major Achievement: SRAM Implementation

### Key Changes
- Successfully implemented SRAM saving for pattern banks
- Fixed cart type configuration in makefile
- Pattern data now persists between power cycles

### Technical Details
- Using MBC5+RAM+BATTERY configuration
- 32KB SRAM allocation
- Save/load functions working for both pattern banks
- Matches planned cartridge specs (4MB / 32KB SRAM with CR1616)

### Current Status
- Both Bank A and Bank B save properly
- Data persists after power cycle
- COPY/PASTE functionality working as expected
- Save/Load menu options functioning correctly

### Next Steps
- Consider adding validation for save data
- Potentially add save state indicators
- Monitor for any edge cases in save/load behavior
