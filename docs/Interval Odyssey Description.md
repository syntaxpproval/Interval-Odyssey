 Interval Odyssey is a Game Boy game being developed using GBDK2020, focusing on music theory learning through gameplay mechanics. The game uses a room-based navigation system where players traverse through interconnected rooms, collecting keys and reaching gates. Each stage contains key rooms, gate rooms, and various other room types including combat, bonus, and corridor rooms, with a central staging room as the starting point.
The core gameplay loop involves finding a key in one of the designated key rooms, which then allows interaction with a gate in the gate room. Upon reaching the gate with the key, players must complete a music-based quiz (identifying chords/intervals) to progress. The game features a stage transition system, where completing a gate room's quiz can lead to the next stage, resetting the key/gate mechanics for the new stage. The project uses a template-based room generation system, and includes various subsystems for player movement, collision detection, sound effects, and quiz interactions.
