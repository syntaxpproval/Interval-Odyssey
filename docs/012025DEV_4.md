# Development Notes - January 20, 2025 (Evening Update 3)

## Sequencer Bug Fix - Grid Selection

### Current Issue
- Grid selection bug where steps can incorrectly retain blank state (TILE_BLANK) when moving cursor during blink animation
- This occurs because draw_step() can commit the visual blink state instead of the actual armed state

### Fix Approach
1. Modify draw_step() to always reference true armed state when leaving a step
2. Separate visual blinking logic from step state management
3. Ensure blank tile state is only used for visual feedback, never stored

### Implementation Plan
1. Update draw_step() function
2. Add state verification
3. Test movement during blink frames

### Next Steps After Fix
- Implement separate step data for each channel (starting with C1)
- ADSR submenu planning
- Attack/Decay/Volume parameter implementation
