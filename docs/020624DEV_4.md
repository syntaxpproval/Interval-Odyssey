# Development Notes - February 6, 2024

## UI Flow Improvements - LOAD and PASTE Operations

### Changes Made
1. Added wait_for_input parameter to show_status_message()
   - If true, shows [A] prompt and waits for input
   - If false, uses original timer behavior

2. Modified status message behavior
   - LOAD and PASTE now require A button press to continue
   - Added visual [A] indicator for user feedback
   - Other operations (SAVE, COPY, CLEAR) maintain original behavior

3. Improved popup menu redraw
   - Added proper redraw after confirmation message
   - Fixed screen cleanup when returning to main popup menu

### Implementation Details
- Added waiting_for_confirm flag to bank_data structure
