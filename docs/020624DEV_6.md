## Menu Visibility Issue Investigation

### Current Behavior
1. After selecting LOAD/PASTE:
   - YE/NO prompt appears (visible)
   - After YES, confirmation appears but menu content missing
   - After confirmation, returns to SAVE/LOAD menu but content missing
   - Only border remains visible in both cases
   - Menu only redraws properly after exit/reentry

### Issue Analysis
- Menu border remains but content disappears
- draw_popup_box() not being called at right times
- Need better redraw sequence handling
- Menu state transitions need adjustment

### Required Fixes
1. Ensure menu is properly redrawn:
   - After showing confirmation message
   - After confirming LOAD/PASTE
   - When returning to main menu
2. Add proper window clearing between states
3. Synchronize menu content with border drawing
