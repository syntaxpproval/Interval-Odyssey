# Development Notes - February 8, 2025 (Part 3)

## Current State
1. Copy/Paste functionality working correctly
2. Menu visibility issues resolved
3. Loading messages clearing properly
4. Basic bank switching working

## Remaining Issues
1. Bank B Data Persistence:
   - Bank B data persists after restart without manual LOAD
   - Bank A requires manual LOAD after restart (desired behavior)
   - Pattern data remains during bank switching (desired)
   - Pattern B shows initial junk data until cleared

## Investigation Path
1. SRAM Handling:
   - Investigated switch_bank() function
   - Attempted modification caused undesired pattern clearing
   - Need to preserve pattern during bank switches while preventing auto-load on restart

## Next Steps
1. Further investigation into:
   - SRAM initialization process
   - Bank existence flag handling
   - Initialization sequence in init_sequencer()
2. Consider separation of:
   - Runtime pattern storage
   - Persistent SRAM storage

## Notes for Next Session
- Preserve current switch_bank() functionality
- Focus on SRAM and initialization handling
- Investigate why Bank B specifically shows different behavior from Bank A
