# Development Notes - January 26, 2025 (Update 2)

## Channel Differentiation Implementation

### Changes Made
- Modified play_sequencer_note() to use distinct duty cycles:
  - Channel 1: 50% duty (0x80)
  - Channel 2: 25% duty (0x40)
- Expected result: Channel 2 will have a thinner, more metallic timbre
- Original envelope and frequency settings preserved
